The Red additionally took both games against Union last season to increase head coach Mike Schafer\u2019s record to 23-10-6 all time against the Dutchmen.<\/p>\n<p>Cornell remains without junior forward and assistant captain Cole Bardraeu, who sat out last weekend\u2019s games against Princeton and Quinnipiac with an undisclosed injury. Junior winger Joel Lowry has transitioned to center to fill Bardraeu\u2019s place on the top line, playing center for the first time in more than six years. During Friday\u2019s home opener against Princeton, Lowry and linemates John McCarron and Christain Hilbrich tallied three goals and four assists en route to the 4-2 win.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cJoel has stepped up and played center \u2014 he hadn\u2019t played center since he was 14 years old, and he walks into a game and has to play at the college level,\u201d Schafer said. \u201cHe\u2019s got great hockey sense and makes great reads, so he\u2019ll continue to play that\u00a0position until Cole gets back.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Lowry currently leads the team with three goals, while McCarron, the team\u2019s captain, paces the squad with seven points and is tied for fourth in the country in points per game. The Red will have their hands full with Rensselaer\u2019s junior forward Ryan Haggerty, ECAC\u2019s October Player of the Month and the national collegiate leader in goals scored.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cRPI is a top-ten team, just like Quinnipiac, so obviously it\u2019s not going to be easy,\u201d McCarron said. \u201cBut [we\u2019re going to] make some simple adjustments and hopefully we can capitalize this weekend.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Union poses double defensive threats with the tandem of senior defenseman Mat Bodie and junior defenseman and Flyers prospect Shayne Gostisbehere, players Schafer called two of the premier defenseman in the league. Schafer added that Union\u2019s style of play closely mirrors the system the Red uses.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThey can be easy prep for us and we\u2019re probably easy prep for them in that you know what you\u2019re going to get,\u201d he said. \u201cOur systems play in the offensive zone and defensive zone are very similar, so it\u2019s like practicing against yourself.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This weekend\u2019s games will be the Red\u2019s first league road games after playing a set of non-conference away games at Nebraska-Omaha to open the season. According to Schafer, the team seemed more frazzled during this past weekend\u2019s home games than during the away games against the Mavericks.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if it was because we were at home \u2014 at Nebraska-Omaha, we were patient, we just kept playing our game \u2014 and here at home, it just seemed like the crowd was getting going, and we got going, and we just didn\u2019t settle down and make that one extra pass coming out of out own zone, or going our weak side as opposed to going up the boards,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>The Red currently ranks third in the country in power plays with a 29.6 percent conversion rate, despite going 0-6 in the game against Quinnipiac. The Red\u2019s difficulty with putting the puck in the back of the net against the Bobcats made a big difference in the game, Schafer said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIn the first period, we had three unbelievable scoring chances to get a goal on the power play,\u201d Schafer said. \u201cEven though it wasn\u2019t clicking, you put one of those in and score one of those goals on the power play, you\u2019re talking about a much different scenario in the game.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>McCarron added that the team is aiming to use last weekend\u2019s loss to find flaws in their play and use that knowledge to improve as the season continues.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think we came back ready to work this week,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, you dream of the undefeated season, but it\u2019s not going to happen. We got it out of the way, obviously a loss is learning process for us. We can take a great Quinnipiac team, watch the video and learn from our mistakes and go forward from there.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>By EMILY BERMAN Less than a week after its shutout loss to fifth-ranked Quinnipiac \u2014 a special-teams dominated affair that saw the Red\u2019s red-hot power play sputter \u2014 the men\u2019s hockey team hits the ice for its second matchup with a top-ten team when it travels to No. 10 Rensselaer [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","date":"2013-11-08 01:41:17","modified":"2013-11-08 11:50:18","categories":[{"id":16,"slug":"sports","title":"Sports","description":"","parent":0,"post_count":171}],"tags":[],"author":{"id":117,"slug":"emilyberman","name":"Emily Berman","first_name":"","last_name":"","nickname":"Emily Berman","url":"","description":"Emily Berman is one of the Assistant Sports Editor of The Sun.

With 23 regular season games remaining, the team is on track for its fifth-straight 20-win season. The Red faces its next challenges at home this weekend, taking on Rensselaer (2-6-1, 1-1) Friday before facing off against Union (4-6, 1-1) Saturday.<\/p>\n<p>The Red, currently ranked third in the NCAA, has not posted a subpar record for five seasons straight and is hoping to continue that streak. Head coach Doug Derraugh, entering his ninth consecutive season with the Red, has led the team to 151-95-18 record since taking over in 2005, when the Cornell team was in the midst of several successive losing seasons. He credits the team atmosphere with the success.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe are be\u00ading fortunate with the student athletes that are coming to Cor\u00adnell,\u201d he said. \u201cWe changed the team culture to where students are hardworking and committed.

Senior defensemen Alyssa Gagliardi and senior forward Jess Campbell were named this season\u2019s captain, and the pair will look to influence the team, and especially newer athletes, to succeed at training at practice and on the time during game time. The Cornell program was able to recruit six talented freshman athletes this year to add to the roster. Derraugh said that the new recruits are expected to contribute.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAll of them can make an immediate impact,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a small roster, so we expect everybody to play, whether that\u2019s starting or contributing on special teams.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Derraugh added that the unpredictable league makes for interesting competition.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cTeams [in the conference] are really strong and the sport is growing,\u201d he said. \u201cThere have been upsets every night, and it is always exciting to see what happens next.\u201d<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>By NIKITA DUBNOV Last year, the women\u2019s ice hockey team put together one of its finest seasons in program history.

In New Jersey, Cornell met its match as league-leading Princeton cruised to a 53-20 win. Dartmouth, meanwhile, watched a last-minute Crimson field goal sink its upset bid at Harvard, 24-21. The Red defense yielded 29 consecutive completions and 605 total yards to the Tigers, and the unit will not be able to rest against a balanced Dartmouth attack that averages 28.6 points and 442.1 yards per game.<\/p>\n<div id=\"attachment_1001265\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"><a href=\"http:\/\/cornellsun.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/Pg-20-Football-Grant-Gellatly-by-Enoch-Newkirk-Staff.jpg\" ><img class=\"size-medium wp-image-1001265 \" alt=\"Enoch Newkirk \/ Sun Staff Photographer\" src=\"http:\/\/cornellsun.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2013\/11\/Pg-20-Football-Grant-Gellatly-by-Enoch-Newkirk-Staff-300x200.jpg\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" \/><\/a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">Enoch Newkirk \/ Sun Staff Photographer<\/p><\/div>\n<p>The reigning Ivy League Rookie of the Year, Green dual-threat quarterback Dalyn Williams, has thrown for 1,390 yards and eight touchdowns in 2013 and added 404 rushing yards with three scores. Last year\u2019s second-team All-Ivy running back, senior Dominick Pierre, is producing another strong campaign with 837 yards and nine touchdowns on the ground while averaging 5.2 yards per carry. On Nov. 3, 2012 in a 44-28 Dartmouth win on Schoellkopf Field, Williams passed for 160 yards and two touchdowns. Williams and Pierre gashed the Red for 250 yards and three scores on the ground.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWilliams is a great two-way QB and Don Pierre [is an] upper echelon running back,\u201d said Cornell first-year head coach David Archer \u201905. \u201cWe have to be assignment-sound, get off of blocks, tackle and take the football away. They\u2019re not as multiple as Princeton in terms of formations, plays and so forth, but they\u2019re certainly a very good football team.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Red senior linebacker Brett Buehler, who leads the Ivies with 75 tackles, spoke about shaking the sting of a lopsided loss and preparing for a new opponent the following week.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen a game like that happens, there\u2019s nothing you ever want to feel,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cBut you just have to take the mindset of getting better after that and improving on what you did well and improving on what you didn\u2019t do well. We\u2019ll just get better and get ready for next week.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Buehler has recorded 228 career tackles, including back-to-back career-highs of 15 and 18 stops. Just as important of a task, though, is to help a young Red defense grow and be ready to flourish once he graduates.<\/p>\n<p>\u201c[Mentoring] has a lot of aspects,\u201d Buehler said. \u201cIt\u2019s being there in practice, getting on them outside of practice, watching film with them \u2014 doing everything possible to make their life here at school and football transition smoothly \u2026 Hopefully [we are] starting something that continues strong into the future.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Another member of the senior class leaving a legacy in Ithaca is quarterback and NFL prospect Jeff Mathews. The gunslinger has thrown for over 2,300 yards and 17 touchdowns in his final season at Cornell. His 10,647 career yards is eight fewer than the 25th most prolific passer in FCS history, Eastern Illinois\u2019 Sean Payton, now head coach of the New Orleans Saints.<\/p>\n<p>According to Mathews\u2019 top target, senior receiver Grant Gellatly, he does not mind carrying the offense on his back, either. Mathews accounts for 87.8 percent of his team\u2019s offense, highest in the nation, though the Red has enjoyed two productive games in a row from sophomore running back Luke Hagy.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cObviously we put a ton of pressure on Jeff because we\u2019re always throwing the ball,\u201d said Gellatly, who leads the Ancient Eight in receptions (64) and yards (851). \u201cHe has a lot on his plate and we\u2019re giving him a lot of responsibility, but he loves the challenge because he\u2019s a big competitor, and I don\u2019t think he\u2019d want it any other way.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Gellatly and the Cornell offense, however, have been far from perfect. Dartmouth\u2019s top-ranked scoring defense (20.6 points per game) and second-best pass defense (208.6 yards per game) will seek to frustrate a Red group that is converting only 38 percent of third downs.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think we\u2019re getting better, but obviously we just haven\u2019t been consistent,\u201d said Gellatly, who has six touchdown receptions. \u201cWe haven\u2019t been clicking on all cylinders and we just make some critical errors at key situations. \u2026 Dartmouth has a good defense, they\u2019re always consistent and ranked near the top of the Ivy League. They have some good players in the secondary.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Senior linebacker Michael Runger leads the Green with 51 tackles, while sophomore linebacker Will McNamara has returned two interceptions for touchdowns. Although it is no safe bet that Cornell will end its losing skid that started on Sept. 28, the squad is relishing the opportunity to play a high-profile game \u2014 interpreting the national TV attention as a positive rather than a distraction.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s awesome \u2014 it\u2019s a heck of an opportunity,\u201d Archer, the youngest head coach in the country, said on his 31st birthday Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s a great chance to recreate ourselves and press the reset button on our emotions to totally forget what\u2019s happened in the past. It should be a chance for us to come out and play with passion and a sense of urgency and correct some of the things that have gone wrong to date.\u201d<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>By QUINTIN SCHWAB The Cornell football team looks to snap a six-game losing streak on national television Saturday at 4 p.m. against Dartmouth in Hanover, N.H.

You are a senior captain on the cross country and track and field team. What has that meant to you over the last four years?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Honestly, it\u2019s hard to describe. I think that running, athletics in general, is more of a lifestyle than an extracurricular. My team is my family and running and working out is a daily given for us. We don\u2019t think about it. It has been a huge part of my time but more so, the opportunities that I have had here have meant a lot to me in terms of representing Big Red in terms of other competitive teams, [and] traveling places with my teammates all over the East coast and being able to have that competitive edge that I won\u2019t be able to have once I graduate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2.

My teammates make fun of me because I eat apples all of the time and have been known to eat up to seven apples, which is really crazy. They call me the compost sometimes.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. You also compete as a mid-distance runner for the track and field team; what\u2019s your favorite event?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s funny because my favorite event is actually the 1500m, but my best event is probably the 3K. I just have a soft spot in my heart for the 1500 so I do both, but that is my favorite.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. You are from California; what\u2019s the thing that most reminds you of home?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think that my mom cooking for me and not bringing home any jackets or anything like that. Just being able to walk around in flip flops year round.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What does your mom cook? Does she cook something special?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Stir fry. She takes good care of me. I have to eat healthy in season so lots of fish and vegetable stir fry.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5. You are a biological sciences major in Arts &amp; Sciences. What got you into that?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I am actually a double major. I am Bio and Government. I am pre-med, but also really interested in health policy. That is where the government comes in. I want to do clinical work and be a practicing physician, but I also want to work behind the scenes in shaping health and how America views health.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How did you get into that?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I got introduced to it here. I came in as pre-med, but I had always enjoyed government classes in high school. I just took some here to fulfill distribution requirements and ended up adding the major. I started taking some PAM courses and thought that policy was very interesting. \u00ad<\/p>\n<p><strong>6. Other than running, what else do you do in your spare time?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I love to cook, but I won\u2019t lie that running takes up a lot of my time. I also really love traveling. I am really into backpacking. This past summer, I did Peru and Bolivia. The summer before that, I did Europe.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Where in Europe did you go?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>All over. Holland, Poland, Austria, Spain, Italy, England and France.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How long was that trip?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Seven weeks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>7. Where is your favorite place to study on campus?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There is a TA mini independent study room in Ives. Whenever there is not a TA in there, I always go in there. I like to be in totally silent study places.<\/p>\n<p><strong>8. If we opened up your music playlist before a meet, what would be on it?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lately, it has been Counting Stars by OneRepublic. I love that song. It\u2019s my go to song for this season right now.<\/p>\n<p><strong>9. Do your teammates have any nicknames for you? What do they call you?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I think I am one of the few teammates that doesn\u2019t have an interesting nickname. Emmy is my nickname.<\/p>\n<p><strong>10. If you could trade places and be on any of the men\u2019s sports team at Cornell, which team would you choose and why?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Probably diving. I think that diving is so beautiful to watch. I wish I was that graceful, but I am not.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Are you a good swimmer?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I actually did swim growing up from when I was four to 16.

Week nine means we&#8217;re officially past the halfway point of the season, yet I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s still more we don&#8217;t know than we do.<br \/>\nThe Saints lost to the Jets. The Panthers blew out the Falcons. The Cowboys escaped the Vikings. The Titans outlasted the Rams. The Eagles ran away from the Raiders. The Chargers were upended by the Redskins. The Dolphins sacked the Bengals. The Cardinals, Giants and Lions all enjoyed byes. The Bears outlasted the Packers. There\u2019s no separation between these teams. I feel as if each of the teams could beat or lose to any one of the others.<br \/>\nThe only teams I feel comfortable saying are very good are the Seahawks, 49ers, Chiefs, Broncos, Colts and Patriots, while the Saints are on the precipice. The only teams I feel comfortable calling very bad are the the Buccaneers, Jaguars, Rams and Vikings. Every other team is essentially interchangeable in my mind.<br \/>\nAre the Colts the third best team in the AFC?<br \/>\nIn short, I believe so. While I believe the two best teams in the AFC reside in the West \u2014 Broncos and Chiefs \u2014 I believe the Colts are the biggest wild card in the AFC. The Colts have already\u00a0beaten the Broncos and crushed the 49ers, accounting for two of the most impressive wins for any team this season.<br \/>\nAndrew Luck has taken the next step and is as dangerous as any QB in the NFL, possibly save Peyton Manning. The Colts are also loaded on offense. To complement this, they have a real home field advantage in Indianapolis and a more than capable defense. Assuming the Colts win the AFC South (which isn&#8217;t much of an assumption at this point), that means they play at least one playoff game at home, against possibly the Broncos or Chiefs, depending on who wins the west. The Colts have as good a shot of upending either of them as anyone in the AFC, and therefore could find a clear path to the AFC Championship game. It\u2019s pretty easy for me to see the Colts representing the AFC in New York in February.<br \/>\nWait; are the Chiefs the best team in the NFL?<br \/>\nOnly a few weeks after saying I believe the Broncos might run the table, the Chiefs are the lone unbeaten team. The Chiefs are now 9-0, but their schedule begins to heat up big time. In the next six games, the Chiefs\u2019 schedule includes the Broncos twice and the Colts. Many believe the Chiefs aren&#8217;t as good as their record indicates, and think this stretch will expose them. While I don&#8217;t expect them to go 16-0 or 15-1, I still think they have the best defense in the NFL and feature good enough offense. If I had to pick a team as the best in the NFL, I&#8217;d still say the Broncos. But I&#8217;d have to think about it.<br \/>\nOf course, the Broncos feature the best offense in the NFL, one that is clicking on historic levels. And if the Chiefs could find a way to clinch home field in the AFC (i.e. go 1-1 against Denver), this will have huge implications on the playoffs. Could anyone knock off the Chiefs in Arrowhead in the playoffs? It&#8217;s a tough question for any offense. The undefeated Chiefs are better than a lot of people think.<br \/>\nHow bad is the Vikings QB situation?<br \/>\nStill very bad. But possibly getting better. After Josh Freeman&#8217;s horrific start against the Giants, Christian Ponder has played adequately. Unfortunately, that&#8217;s all the hope Vikings fans get for now. This, plus a mortal Adrian Peterson, has put the Vikings at one win and counting. Maybe Johnny Football will be calling the signals next year.<br \/>\nDid two franchise quarterbacks come out of nowhere?<br \/>\nIn an age of dynamism at the QB position, Case Keenum and Nick Foles look like the future, while reminding many fans of the past. As Mike Vick and Matt Schaub declined faster than most thought, we&#8217;ve seen the emergence of Keenum and Foles seemingly out of nowhere. Foles had dabbled in Philadelphia, but Keenum is a total shock. There&#8217;s long been a QB controversy brewing in Philadelphia, but it appears Foles made it less of a controversy and more of a no-brainer. Unlike recent young QB stars, and it\u2019s a stretch to call them stars, both are pocket passers who have put up gaudy numbers all of a sudden. Foles joined an exclusive fraternity of quarterbacks by throwing for seven touchdowns last week, while Keenum has been impressive in his own right. Keenum&#8217;s start has led to huge days from Andre Johnson and seems to be pointing the Texans in the right direction again.<br \/>\nHow does Greg Schiano still have a job?<br \/>\nI don&#8217;t know; but he won&#8217;t have one for long. The Buccaneers are a mess, and his team is imploding. It&#8217;s my belief that coaches in the NFL are fired too often, but Schiano is a rare case where I can&#8217;t wrap my head around how he&#8217;s still employed. His team is awful, his players don&#8217;t respect him, no one seems to publicly support him, and the Freeman situation was handled disastrously. He&#8217;s an embarrassment to the Buccaneers organization.<br \/>\nAre the Jaguars really that bad?<br \/>\nYes.<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>By JOHN ZAKOUR After NFL week nine, what did we learn?

The squad will take on Colgate at home, a perennial instate rival that is notorious for giving the Red a tough game.<br \/>\n\u201cWell we know the game is going to be intense and full of energy. \u2026 It\u2019s both team\u2019s season opener, so with that you\u2019re going to get two teams playing their toughest basketball,\u201d said senior guard Stephanie Long. \u201cWe expect pressure from Colgate and are prepped to handle it.\u201d<br \/>\nIn last season\u2019s opener, the Red escaped Colgate\u2019s home court with a 69-65 victory, but it took a substantial rally down the stretch. Trailing by six with just three minutes left to play, senior forward Allyson DiMagno sparked the Red\u2019s offense by sinking a pair of free throws. Clare Fitzpatrick \u201913 followed suit with a basket of her own and after a defensive stop, Fitzpatrick converted on an and-one to put the visitors up by one with just over a minute left. DiMagno scored again on the next possession to cap a 10-0 run, and the Red never looked back, hitting crucial free throws down the stretch to seal the victory. According to DiMagno, the Red can look forward to a similarly hotly contested matchup.<br \/>\n\u201cWe are expecting a hard-fought game against a team that we have had several nail biters against in the past,\u201d she said.<br \/>\nFitzpatrick and point guard Spencer Lane \u201913 were the leaders in that game. Fitzpatrick put up 19 points and Lane finished with 13 points and four steals. However, the Red will have to look for other options this season to fill in the void that Fitzpatrick and Lane have left behind.<br \/>\n\u201cAlthough Clare and Spencer left some holes from graduation, I believe that this team is ready to fill those holes,\u201d DiMagno said. \u201cAt this point, it is hard to say that one specific person will be able to completely do what those two did, but it is apparent that this team is willing to come together and replace what we lost.\u201d<br \/>\nDiMagno led the squad in scoring and rebounding last year, averaging a double-double with 14.7 points and 11.5 rebounds. Though she will likely be the Red\u2019s main threat down low, the squad will also look to junior forward Sarah Poland to provide some important support in the paint. At 6-3, Poland is the tallest player on the roster and will provide some much-needed length in the post. As for the point guard position, seniors Shelby Lyman and Long both have experience running the offense. Lyman and Long combined for 12.4 points per game last season and are the Red\u2019s main shooting threats from beyond the arc.

According to Long, forwards Nicholle Aston and Nia Marshall have proven they can battle on the low block, and guards Kerri Moran and Megan LeDuc have displayed an ability to run the offense.<br \/>\n\u201cKerri and Nia in particular have quickly adjusted to the game, and the returners have a lot of confidence in them despite being young,\u201d Long said.<br \/>\nColgate opens up their season as well on Friday after a disappointing 10-21 finish last year. The squad returns three starters, including junior Missy Repoli, who was the Raiders\u2019 leading scorer through the first half of the season before being sidelined with an injury. Repoli led Colgate in scoring in the loss to Cornell last season with 11 points. Though the Raiders are picked to finish last in the Patriot League, Long said her team is prepared for anything the Raiders will throw at them.<br \/>\n\u201cWe\u2019re pretty familiar with Colgate\u2019s style of play,\u201d Long said. \u201cThey have some quick guards who pressure and deny on defense, and some tall forwards who can do some things in the post. Our coaches do a great job of prepping us with x\u2019s and o\u2019s, so we know we will have the tools to win going into Friday.\u201d<br \/>\nThe Red was picked to finish sixth in the Ivy League Preseason media poll, coming in ahead of Columbia and Brown. Princeton, the winner of four straight Ivy titles, is once again the favorite to headline the Ancient Eight this season. According to Long, the ranking will only serve to encourage the Red to prove it wrong.<br \/>\n\u201cWe always take the preseason rank with a grain of salt,\u201d Long said. \u201cThe Ivy League is so volatile \u2014 teams change drastically every year. We know the skill and determination that we have, and we absolutely believe that we will finish above that prediction.\u201d<\/p>\n","excerpt":"<p>By SCOTT CHIUSANO Coming off a 13-15 finish last year, the women\u2019s basketball team draws a clean slate this Friday in its season opener, beginning the quest for its first above .500 record since 2007, when the Red won the Ivy League.

The annual 5k regatta included nearly 50 boats from Cornell, Syracuse, Ithaca College, Bucknell and Hobart. The heavyweight, lightweight and women\u2019s boats braved the brisk fall morning in two races. These races, which took place on Cayuga Lake, were the Red\u2019s last chance to compete against other boats until the spring. In the first race, all three programs had a boat finish within the Top-25 times. The heavyweight team had six boats finish in the Top-25, including a win by the freshman eight boat. Their time was six seconds faster than the second place finisher, the Syracuse freshman eight. The freshman eight B boat placed fourth, followed by the four A boat whose time was sixth best in the session. Many of the boats contained new lineups, which made the times exciting, according to sophomore Pierre Hills.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI was very impressed with my boat\u2019s performance,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had only practiced in the lineup once before the race, [so] it was difficult to predict how we were going to perform. We stayed focused and improved throughout the piece.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The lightweight team had three boats finish in the Top-25, with the freshman eight boat putting in the strongest performance and earning fifth place. The freshman eight B boat was the next best finisher for the program, completing the race in 18th place. The women were also able to get in the Top-25 with thier varsity eight boat\u2019s 24th place finish, the highest finish of any women\u2019s boat in the first session.<\/p>\n<p>The second session included fewer boats, and the coaches changed the lineups in some cases in order to evaluate their rowers in different situations. The lightweight program had three Top-10 finishes that highlighted the second race of the day. The lightweight varsity eight came in first place by more than four seconds over Hobart\u2019s heavyweight varsity eight.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThe lightweight varsity 8 had a very impressive performance, taking first place overall in a field of heavyweights,\u201d freshman Daniel O\u2019Neill said.<\/p>\n<p>The heavyweight freshman boats also had Top-10 finishes. The freshman eight\u2019s time placed them in seventh, and the freshman eight B boat came in close behind in\u00a0ninth place.<\/p>\n<p>The women\u2019s varsity eight boat finished in 23rd, once again the strongest finish out of all the women\u2019s boats entered in the race.<\/p>\n<p>Saturday\u2019s competition allowed all three teams to give some younger rowers experience with different lineups in a competitive atmosphere. The coaches have encouraged the younger rowers to push themselves in order to create depth across all class levels, according to Hills.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cCoach Smith is constantly changing the boats around, forcing the rowers to understand that they are all at the same level, [and] capable of the same feats,\u201d he said. \u201cThis will allow for more collective efforts throughout the season, ridding the team of any sort of dependence on \u2018key rowers.\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Cornell Fall Regatta marked the end of the fall season and the beginning of winter training for all three programs.

Douglas said she is confident the Red has made the necessary preparations throughout the off season to encourage future success.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur team came back to campus fit and strong after summer break,\u201d she said. \u201cWe got right into mid-season workouts in September to make up for a few lost weeks at the end of the season, with Ivies being sooner than last year.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The men also spent an ample amount of time training during the off-season.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have spent a lot of time in the gym and in the pool, and we are feeling strong going into the\u00a0season,\u201d Hallowell said. \u201cThis weekend will be a good test for us, especially with so many Ivy meets in the next month.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The men\u2019s off-season training was tougher than usual, putting the team in a much stronger position this season, according to Satterthwaite.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think this year\u2019s off-season training has been tougher than in previous years so going into the meet season the team as a whole will be in much better shape than usual,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that the team is more excited than &#8230; before to start racing and beating some teams in the Ivy League. I think we all feel good and are ready to get some victories against our real rivals.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Overall, the men say they feel ready to face their future competition. \u201cThe team is feeling strong and excited,\u201d Hallowell said. \u201cEveryone looks forward to racing, and this year it\u2019s obvious we\u2019re all ready to get back into it.
